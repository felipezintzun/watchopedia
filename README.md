# Watchopedia

# Description

I am a movie & tv show lover but I do not know what I want to watch. I open watchopedia and search by (actor, tv show, or movie). The website populates results of the search. I can save some of those titles to favorites. If I have no idea what I feel like watching the website has a featured section at the homepage.
