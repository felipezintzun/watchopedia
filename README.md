# watchopedia

I am a movie & tv show lover but I do not know what I want to watch. I open watchopedia and search by (genre, actor, ratings).
The website populates some recommendations. I can save some of those titles to favorites. If I have no idea what I feel like watching the 
website has a featured section at the homepage.

Issues:

MVP 
- Create search card
- Link the two API to the website
    https://rapidapi.com/blog/top-free-music-data-apis/
    https://tastedive.com/read/api
    https://trakt.docs.apiary.io/
    https://developer.movieglu.com/

- Determine how many recommendations it will populate after search
- Save to local storage
- Create buttons dynamically for genres, actors, ratings
- Create a favorites section
- Stylize using other CSS framework (SASS)

WISH LIST
- Create future watching list
- Users can comments add ratings
- Show local movie times
